<p align=center>Discord bot for retrieving the latest in Overwatch League and Contenders news! Root for your favorite teams and players right from your Discord community! ðŸŽ®âœ¨ </p>

## 2020 Update
The Overwatch League API which was once open to the public had shut down in 2019 in favor of the Stats Lab. I and several other developers tried to leverage the stats lab to no avail. It wasn't until some further complications that I had to shut the bot down. 

It has been a pleasure developing this bot. It's growth and influence was unexpected! If I can't run this bot anymore, I figured now's a perfect time to point and laugh at the spaghetti code behind Pachimari. Enjoy!
